# Product-shopping-cart-page
In this Project, I show how to create a shopping cart page that updates and deletes items using the local Storage Concept . This project will also be a good for beginner to understand the concept of shopping-cart-page.

# JavaScript Shopping Cart Project

This project showcases several JavaScript concepts and features. Here's a breakdown:

## DOM Manipulation:

The code interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) using `document.getElementById` and `innerHTML` to update the content of HTML elements.

## LocalStorage:

It utilizes the `localStorage` API to store and retrieve data persistently on the user's browser. The shopping cart data is stored in the local storage using `localStorage.setItem` and retrieved using `localStorage.getItem`.

## Event Handling:

It uses event handlers like `onclick` to trigger functions (`increment` and `decrement`) when certain elements (e.g., buttons) are clicked.

## Template Literals:

It makes use of template literals (\`\`) for string interpolation, making it easier to create dynamic strings with variables.

## Array Methods:

It uses array methods like `map`, `find`, `filter`, and `reduce` for manipulating arrays of data (`shopItemsData` and `basket`).

## Arrow Functions:

It defines functions using arrow function syntax (`() => {}`).

## Conditional (Ternary) Operator:

It employs the ternary operator (`condition ? expr1 : expr2`) for concise conditional statements.

## Object Destructuring:

It uses object destructuring to extract values from objects, e.g., `{ id, name, price, desc, img } = item`.

## HTML and CSS:

It generates HTML dynamically using JavaScript, creating product elements and updating quantities on the webpage.

## Updating the UI Dynamically:

It dynamically updates the UI in response to user interactions, such as incrementing/decrementing item quantities and updating the shopping cart icon.

## Functional Programming:

It employs a functional programming style, with functions like `generateShop`, `increment`, `decrement`, `update`, and `calculation` performing specific tasks and interacting with each other.

In summary, the code demonstrates a simple shopping cart functionality that dynamically updates the UI and utilizes concepts from DOM manipulation, local storage, event handling, array manipulation, and more.
